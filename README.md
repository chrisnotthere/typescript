# TypeScript Learning Project

This project is a collection of TypeScript code snippets and examples, designed to facilitate the learning and understanding of TypeScript. Each file explores different TypeScript concepts:

- **Arrays**: Explains how to use and manipulate arrays in TypeScript, including different methods available for arrays.
- **Enums**: Provides examples of how to define and work with enumerated types (enums), a way of giving friendly names to sets of numeric values.
- **Functions**: Shows how to define and use functions, including optional and default parameters, rest parameters, and arrow functions.
- **Objects**: Details how to use objects in TypeScript, including how to define them and work with their properties and methods.
- **Unions**: Explores the use of union types to allow a variable to be of one of several types.
- **Tuples**: Demonstrates how to define and use tuples, which are arrays where the type of a fixed number of elements is known.
- **Interfaces**: Defines and implements interfaces in TypeScript, providing a means to define custom types.
- **Type Narrowing**: Showcases TypeScript's type checking capabilities to automatically refine the type of a variable within conditional blocks.
- **Abstract Classes**: Outlines the creation of abstract classes, which can't be instantiated but can be inherited from. It also details the rules around implementing abstract methods in child classes.
- **Generics**: Demonstrates how to use type variables to create reusable components that work over several types.
- **Type Predicates**: Explains how to handle custom type narrowing.
- **Discriminated Unions**: Displays how to create a type that can be one of several types and exhaustively check all of these in a switch statement.

## Usage

This project isn't designed to be run as a single application, but rather studied and experimented with.

Feel free to use these code snippets and explanations as a basis for further experimentation and learning in TypeScript!

## Acknowledgements

This project is based on [Learn TypeScript â€“ Full Tutorial by freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30LWjhZzg50&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) and the [Official TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/). I highly recommend these resources for anyone wanting to dive deeper into TypeScript.
